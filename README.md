ngSchool 2015
===============
THis is a demo app for all the cool stuff in VS 2015!
Using bower, npm, grunt etc.
Work in progress more to come!
Currently, the scripts in the project.json file don't appear to be working. After cloning the repo, run npm install manually. Once npm install is run, you can then run the bower tasks which will take care of the rest. Once i have it figured out i will update.
